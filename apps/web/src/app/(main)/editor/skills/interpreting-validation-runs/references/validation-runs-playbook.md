# Validation Runs Playbook

## Purpose

Use this reference when the main skill tells you to explain command output in a
root-cause-first way.

## Command Matrix

| Command          | What it proves                                                  | What it cannot prove                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm lint`      | Static rule compliance for the files in ESLint scope            | Runtime correctness, type soundness beyond lint rules        |
| `pnpm typecheck` | TypeScript-visible contract consistency                         | Runtime behavior, mocked module shape, build-only boundaries |
| `pnpm test`      | Behavior under the current runner, environment, and mocks       | Production bundling behavior or unsupported environments     |
| `pnpm build`     | Production compilation, bundling, and Next.js build-time checks | End-to-end runtime behavior after deployment                 |

## Signal Mapping

### `lint`

| Signal                               | Likely root cause                | Interpretation tip                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Same rule repeated across many files | `rule-violation` or config drift | Check the shared abstraction or lint config owner before editing many files |
| One rule in one file                 | `rule-violation`                 | Usually a direct local fix                                                  |
| Autofix-safe wording                 | `rule-violation`                 | Mention that the failure may be mechanical                                  |

### `typecheck`

| Signal                      | Likely root cause                     | Interpretation tip                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Missing exported member     | `type-contract-break`                 | Usually import/export drift, not a test problem    |
| Property does not exist     | `type-contract-break`                 | Data model or API contract moved                   |
| Type not assignable         | `type-contract-break`                 | Compare caller expectations with callee output     |
| Cannot find module or alias | `type-contract-break` or config drift | Check `tsconfig.json` and related toolchain config |

### `test`

| Signal                        | Likely root cause                             | Interpretation tip                                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `expected x to be y`          | `behavior-regression`                         | Product behavior or stale expectation                        |
| `is not a function`           | `type-contract-break` or `test-harness-break` | Decide whether the export changed or the mock shape is wrong |
| Mock export complaints        | `test-harness-break`                          | Usually test setup, not product runtime                      |
| URL or path scheme exceptions | `test-harness-break`                          | Environment-specific path handling                           |
| Timeout or restart errors     | `test-harness-break` or orchestration issue   | Check async ownership and harness assumptions                |

### `build`

| Signal                 | Likely root cause      | Interpretation tip                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Compilation stopped    | `build-pipeline-break` | Report the build blocker first                     |
| Prerender crash        | `build-pipeline-break` | Usually server/client or data-fetch boundary       |
| Warning with zero exit | Risk, not failure      | Explain why it matters without misreporting status |

## Cross-Stage Heuristics

- If `lint` and `typecheck` pass but `test` fails, prefer product logic,
  runtime wiring, or harness analysis over config theory.
- If `typecheck` fails and `build` also fails, treat the type error as the
  earlier owner unless build reveals a distinct production-only problem.
- If `build` passes with warnings, keep the status as pass and record the
  warning under risk.
- If `test` emits many failures, cluster by repeated signal before summarizing.

## Report Style

Use short, high-signal summaries:

```markdown
- Command: pnpm test
- Status: failed
- Root cause: test-harness-break
- Evidence: No "default" export is defined on the "node:child_process" mock
- Owning area: test mock setup for the bridge module
- Next step: fix the mock shape, then rerun the affected test file
```

## Repo-Specific Notes

- `pnpm test` uses coverage and excludes end-to-end tests. Ignore coverage
  chatter unless the task is about coverage itself.
- `pnpm build` uses `next build`, which can surface warnings after a successful
  build. Record them separately from failures.
- `pnpm validate` does not include `pnpm build`; do not claim build health from
  `validate` alone.
