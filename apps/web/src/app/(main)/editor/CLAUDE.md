# CLAUDE.md

## قاعدة منع إضعاف ملفات الفحص والتحقق

This checks rule must be read and explicitly proven before any analysis, edit, or execution.

Do not weaken any check, verification, test, lint, build, security, or operational health file in a way that makes it more permissive, less capable of finding defects, narrower in coverage, or easier to pass.

Any change touching checks or verification files must be followed by a direct run of the affected check and the suitable reference verification path. Do not close the round through file reading or text comparison alone.

Any startup brief requiring 3 to 7 operational facts must include one explicit fact proving the checks rule was read.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Startup Contract

Before using any local guidance in this file:

1. Read:

```text
AGENTS.md
```

2. Read:

```text
output/session-state.md
```

3. Read only what you need from:

```text
output/code-map/*
output/mind-map/*
```

4. Output a short brief with 3 to 7 operational facts, including one explicit fact proving the checks rule was read.
5. Only then continue with the subtree-specific guidance below.

At the end of the round:

1. Update:

```text
output/round-notes.md
```

2. Update:

```text
output/session-state.md
```

when the operational or structural truth changes. 3. Output a short handoff brief with what changed, what was verified, and what remains open.

This file is not the top-level contract for the repository.

Do not treat any OCR, RAG, indexing, vector search, or local retrieval notes in this file as a source of truth. Those concerns remain governed by:

```text
AGENTS.md
.repo-agent/RAG-OPERATING-CONTRACT.md
output/session-state.md
```

## Project Overview

**Avan Titre (أفان تيتر)** — Arabic professional screenplay editor for web. Built with React 19 + Next.js 15 + Tiptap 3 (ProseMirror) frontend and Express 5 backend. The core feature is a multi-layer classification pipeline that auto-classifies pasted/imported Arabic screenplay text into 10 element types: `action`, `dialogue`, `character`, `scene_header_1`, `scene_header_2`, `scene_header_3`, `transition`, `parenthetical`, `basmala`.

## Commands

```bash
# Development

# Retrieval Notes
Local OCR or retrieval references in this file are not a source of truth.
Use the repository-level governance and live state instead.

## Architecture

### Hybrid Pattern (React + Imperative Classes)

- **React components** (`App.tsx`, `app-shell/`) for top-level UI state and layout
- **Imperative class** (`EditorArea.ts`) for Tiptap editor lifecycle — ProseMirror state is managed outside React
- **Next.js App Router** (`app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`) as the entry point with RTL dark-theme layout

### Multi-Layer Classification Pipeline

Text classification flows through `paste-classifier.ts` (main entry point):

1. **Line Normalization & Segmentation** — clean and split input
2. **HybridClassifier** (`hybrid-classifier.ts`) — regex patterns + context rules + confidence scoring
3. **PostClassificationReviewer** (`classification-core.ts`) — 8 quality detectors flag suspicious lines
4. **SequenceOptimization** — Viterbi algorithm for structural consistency
5. **Self-Reflection Pass** — AI cross-check
6. **RetroactiveCorrection** — fixes broken character names
7. **Agent Review** — optional LLM escalation when suspicion score >= 74 with >= 2 detector findings

Routing bands: `pass` → `local-review` → `agent-candidate` → `agent-forced`

### Context System

- `context-memory-manager.ts` — short-term context tracking (characters, locations, dialogue blocks)
- `document-context-graph.ts` — full document structure graph for context-aware classification
- `pipeline-recorder.ts` — records classification pipeline stages for diagnostics

### Frontend → Backend Endpoints

| Endpoint                       | Purpose                                         | AI Provider                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/file-extract`       | Extract text from PDF/DOC/DOCX/TXT/Fountain/FDX | Mistral (OCR)                                       |
| `POST /api/agent/review`       | Classify suspicious lines                       | Configured review provider via `AGENT_REVIEW_MODEL` |
| `POST /api/final-review`       | Secondary review (Command API v2)               | Configured review provider via `FINAL_REVIEW_MODEL` |
| `POST /api/ai/context-enhance` | Context-aware correction (SSE)                  | Google Gemini                                       |
| `POST /api/export/pdfa`        | HTML → PDF via Puppeteer                        | —                                                   |

### Key Source Directories

- `src/extensions/` — Tiptap extensions + classification engine. `paste-classifier.ts` is the main classification entry point
- `src/pipeline/` — Import orchestration, agent command engine, quality routing
- `src/components/app-shell/` — AppHeader, AppSidebar, AppDock, AppFooter
- `src/components/editor/EditorArea.ts` — Imperative Tiptap editor wrapper class
- `src/rag/` — legacy/local notes only; repository truth remains in the root agent contracts and live state
- `src/ocr-arabic-pdf-to-txt-pipeline/` — Separate OCR subsystem with MCP server
- `server/` — Express backend (`.mjs` files): file extraction, AI review, OCR, vision proofread

### Editor Configuration

- **Tiptap 3** on **ProseMirror** with `@tiptap-pro/extension-pages` for A4 pagination (794x1123px @ 96 PPI)
- Each screenplay element is a custom Tiptap block node extension in `src/extensions/`
- `src/editor.ts` — `createScreenplayEditor()` factory and `SCREENPLAY_ELEMENTS` registry
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+0 through Ctrl+7 for element type switching

## Code Conventions

- **File naming:** kebab-case (e.g., `context-memory-manager.ts`)
- **Classes:** PascalCase (e.g., `PostClassificationReviewer`)
- **Constants:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `SCREENPLAY_ELEMENTS`)
- **Server files:** `.mjs` extension (ES modules for Node.js)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with OKLCH color system, RTL-first, dark-only theme
- **Package manager:** pnpm 10.28 — do not use npm or yarn
- **Language:** Arabic UI throughout, RTL layout. Code comments may be in Arabic.
- **Path aliases:** `@/*` maps to `./src/*`

### Strict TypeScript Rules

- Never use `any` or `unknown`
- Never use `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error`
- Always import real types from their source libraries, don't invent custom types when official ones exist
- Find root/ideal solutions, not temporary workarounds

## Type System

- `ElementType`: `action`, `dialogue`, `character`, `scene_header_1`, `scene_header_2`, `scene_header_3`, `transition`, `parenthetical`, `basmala`
- `ClassifiedDraft` — core unit of classified text (type, text, confidence, classificationMethod)
- Type definitions live in `src/types/` (classification-types.ts, screenplay.ts, agent-review.ts, editor-engine.ts, typing-system.ts)

## Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Review provider selection is provider-agnostic:

- `AGENT_REVIEW_MODEL` / `AGENT_REVIEW_FALLBACK_MODEL` — `provider:model` for suspicious-line review
- `FINAL_REVIEW_MODEL` / `FINAL_REVIEW_FALLBACK_MODEL` — `provider:model` for final review
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required only when either review channel uses `anthropic:*`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — required only when either review channel uses `openai:*`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — required for `google-genai:*` review models and context enhancement
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` / `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` — required for `deepseek:*` review models
- `MISTRAL_API_KEY` — PDF OCR
- `ANTIWORD_PATH` / `ANTIWORDHOME` — DOC extraction (Windows: `C:/antiword/antiword.exe`)

The official backend runs on `http://localhost:3001`. The editor reaches it through the Next.js API routes (for example `/api/file-extract`), while frontend env vars use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

## Testing

- **Unit/Integration:** Vitest 4.0 with jsdom. Config: `vitest.config.ts` (unit), `vitest.pipeline.config.ts` (integration)
- **E2E:** Playwright with Chromium. Config: `playwright.config.ts`
- **Coverage:** v8 provider, output in `test-results/coverage/`
- Test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`, helpers in `tests/helpers/`, harness in `tests/harness/`
